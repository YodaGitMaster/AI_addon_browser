## Latest Major Enhancement: Model Settings Menu
- **Status**: COMPLETED - Settings menu with model selection implemented
- **Feature**: Users can now select and save their preferred AI model
- **UI Flow**: 
  1. User clicks settings gear icon in header
  2. Modal opens with model selection dropdown
  3. Shows available models from Ollama server
  4. User clicks any available model to select it
  5. User saves settings to apply the model
  6. Extension uses selected model for all future requests
- **Available Models**: 
  - gemma3:4b (Default)
  - gemma3n:e4b (New)
- **Implementation**: 
  - Added settings button to sidebar header
  - Modal interface with clickable model list
  - Browser storage for persistent settings
  - Real-time model availability checking
  - Automatic status update when model changes
  - Interactive model selection with visual feedback
- **Benefits**: 
  - User control over AI model selection
  - Persistent settings across sessions
  - Real-time model availability display
  - Easy switching between different models
  - Intuitive click-to-select interface

## Previous Enhancement: Chart Analysis Enhancement
- **Status**: COMPLETED - Enhanced trading analysis with values-first approach
- **Change**: Chart analysis now always starts with data values description
- **NEW Structure**: 
  1. **Chart Values & Data** - Specific prices, timeframes, data points
  2. **Chart Commentary** - Visual patterns and formations
  3. **Technical Analysis** - Trends, support/resistance, indicators
  4. **Market Outlook** - Direction assessment
  5. **Recommendation** - Clear BUY/SELL with reasoning
- **Benefits**: 
  - More structured and comprehensive analysis
  - Always starts with concrete data before interpretation
  - Better context for trading decisions
  - Consistent analysis format

## Previous Enhancement: Image Selection UX Overhaul
- **Status**: COMPLETED - Inverse selection logic implemented
- **Change**: FROM removal-based TO selection-based image management
- **OLD**: All images included by default, user removes unwanted ones
- **NEW**: No images selected by default, user explicitly selects desired ones
- **Benefits**: 
  - More intuitive UX (explicit selection vs deletion)
  - Better control over what gets sent to AI
  - Clearer visual feedback with checkboxes
  - Select All/Clear All convenience buttons

## Content Extraction Priority Update
- **Status**: COMPLETED - Optimized content focus with comprehensive filtering
- **Priority**: article > main > all page
- **Logic**: 
  1. `<article>` - Most specific for article content
  2. `<main>` - Main content area fallback  
  3. Full page body - Last resort fallback
- **Comprehensive Filtering**: Removes all accessory elements:
  - Navigation (nav, breadcrumbs, pagination)
  - Sidebars and widgets (all variations)
  - Advertising and promotional content
  - Social sharing and follow buttons
  - Comments and user interaction sections
  - Related content and recommendations
  - Footnotes and references
  - Metadata and publication info
  - Search and filter elements
  - Cookie notices and legal text
  - Popups and overlays
  - Technical elements (scripts, iframes)
  - CMS-specific elements (WordPress, Elementor, etc.)
  - Small text blocks (< 10 characters)
- **Benefits**: 
  - Much cleaner context focused on main content
  - Better AI analysis with reduced noise
  - Consistent content quality across different websites
  - Graceful degradation when semantic elements missing
