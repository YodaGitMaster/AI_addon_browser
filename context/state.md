## Latest Major Enhancement: Chart Analysis Enhancement
- **Status**: COMPLETED - Enhanced trading analysis with values-first approach
- **Change**: Chart analysis now always starts with data values description
- **NEW Structure**: 
  1. **Chart Values & Data** - Specific prices, timeframes, data points
  2. **Chart Commentary** - Visual patterns and formations
  3. **Technical Analysis** - Trends, support/resistance, indicators
  4. **Market Outlook** - Direction assessment
  5. **Recommendation** - Clear BUY/SELL with reasoning
- **Benefits**: 
  - More structured and comprehensive analysis
  - Always starts with concrete data before interpretation
  - Better context for trading decisions
  - Consistent analysis format

## Previous Enhancement: Image Selection UX Overhaul
- **Status**: COMPLETED - Inverse selection logic implemented
- **Change**: FROM removal-based TO selection-based image management
- **OLD**: All images included by default, user removes unwanted ones
- **NEW**: No images selected by default, user explicitly selects desired ones
- **Benefits**: 
  - More intuitive UX (explicit selection vs deletion)
  - Better control over what gets sent to AI
  - Clearer visual feedback with checkboxes
  - Select All/Clear All convenience buttons

## Content Extraction Priority Update
- **Status**: COMPLETED - Optimized content focus with comprehensive filtering
- **Priority**: article > main > all page
- **Logic**: 
  1. `<article>` - Most specific for article content
  2. `<main>` - Main content area fallback  
  3. Full page body - Last resort fallback
- **Comprehensive Filtering**: Removes all accessory elements:
  - Navigation (nav, breadcrumbs, pagination)
  - Sidebars and widgets (all variations)
  - Advertising and promotional content
  - Social sharing and follow buttons
  - Comments and user interaction sections
  - Related content and recommendations
  - Footnotes and references
  - Metadata and publication info
  - Search and filter elements
  - Cookie notices and legal text
  - Popups and overlays
  - Technical elements (scripts, iframes)
  - CMS-specific elements (WordPress, Elementor, etc.)
  - Small text blocks (< 10 characters)
- **Benefits**: 
  - Much cleaner context focused on main content
  - Better AI analysis with reduced noise
  - Consistent content quality across different websites
  - Graceful degradation when semantic elements missing

## Last Completed Action
- **FIXED**: Double message issue resolved
- Root cause: Both `handleSendMessage` and `sendMessageWithImages` were calling `addMessage` for user messages
- Solution: Only create draft messages when images are present, improved draft removal logic
- **RESTORED**: Context menu functionality for right-click access
- Re-enabled context menu click handler after fixing auto-input issue
- Context menus now populate input field without auto-sending (user control maintained)
- **IMPLEMENTED**: Inverse image selection logic
- Modal now shows checkboxes for selection instead of remove buttons
- Images start unselected, user must explicitly check desired ones
- Added Select All/Clear All buttons for convenience
- Visual feedback with green border/background for selected images

## Latest Major Enhancement: Multi-Tab Context Selection
- **Status**: COMPLETED - Multi-tab context selection implemented
- **Feature**: Users can now select multiple tabs to combine their contexts
- **UI Flow**: 
  1. Extension opens with current tab context (default)
  2. User clicks "Edit Context" button in header
  3. Modal shows all open tabs with checkboxes
  4. User selects multiple tabs to combine contexts
  5. Apply → Extension uses combined context from selected tabs
- **Implementation**: 
  - Added "Edit Context" button to sidebar header
  - Tab discovery function filters valid web pages
  - Modal UI with checkboxes for multi-selection
  - Content extraction from multiple selected tabs
  - Context management handles combined contexts
  - UI updates to show selected tabs count
- **Benefits**: 
  - Compare information across multiple pages
  - Analyze related content from different sources
  - More comprehensive context for AI analysis
  - Better insights from combined data sources

## Next Required Steps
1. **TEST**: User tests multi-tab context selection functionality
2. **VERIFY**: Edit Context button opens modal with all valid tabs
3. **VALIDATE**: Multiple tab selection works and combines contexts properly
4. **CONFIRM**: AI receives combined context from selected tabs

## Architecture Changes
- **FROM**: Simple popup with one-time summarization
- **TO**: Standalone desktop-like window with full chat functionality
- **BENEFITS**: 
  - Persistent window (doesn't close when clicking outside)
  - Fully draggable around the screen
  - User-resizable to any size
  - Header always visible with page context
  - Native window behavior (minimize, maximize, close)
  - Copy functionality for easy content sharing
  - Continuous conversation about page content
  - Better user experience with chat-like interface
  - Professional desktop application feel

## Technical Notes
- Image removal now updates `window.pendingImages` immediately on click
- UI animation preserved for better UX but separated from data updates
- Added debugging logs to track image count at send time
- Array synchronization between UI and API payload now guaranteed
- Screenshots only captured when user message contains visual analysis keywords
- `detectCharts()` function now accepts `includeScreenshots` parameter
- `extractPageContent()` modified to conditionally capture screenshots
- On-demand screenshot capture implemented for visual analysis requests
- Improved performance by avoiding unnecessary screenshot operations
- Keyword logic tested independently and works correctly
- "Help me understand this page" should NOT match any visual keywords
- Issue might be cached screenshots from previous interactions
- Added logging to trace: message analysis, keyword matching, image extraction, UI display
- Conditional screenshot system verified working correctly
- Keywords properly detect visual analysis intent
- No screenshots captured for general questions
- Fixed minor JavaScript error (undefined init function)
- System performance improved with on-demand screenshot capture
- Logs confirm: needsVisualAnalysis=false for non-visual requests
- Added image removal debugging with before/after array states
- Added send button debugging with exact array contents
- Added API function debugging with received parameters
- Console will show step-by-step array modifications
- Image removal should modify `window.pendingImages` immediately
- Send button should pass current `window.pendingImages` to API
- Added array cloning in send button to prevent reference issues
- Logs will show: removal actions, array contents, API parameters
- Fixed template literal syntax by using string concatenation instead
- Corrected indentation and brace matching in image removal logic
- JavaScript syntax validation passes
- All debugging features now functional and ready for use

## Data Structures & Formats (schema.md) 

## Current Focus
**Image Removal Synchronization Bug**
- Draft message created with `isEditable=true` (line 261)
- Remove buttons should be attached to each image
- User reports clicking × buttons but images still sent to API
- Need to verify if remove button `onclick` handlers are being triggered

## Next Required Steps
1. **RELOAD**: User reloads extension with new debug logging
2. **TEST**: User types visual analysis request and checks console for:
   - `=== ADD MESSAGE DEBUG ===` (confirms function called with isEditable=true)
   - `=== REMOVE BUTTON CREATION DEBUG ===` (confirms buttons being created)
3. **CLICK TEST**: User clicks × button to check for removal debug logs
4. **ANALYZE**: Based on logs, determine if issue is in creation or event handling

## Technical Context
- Extension uses conditional screenshot capture (working correctly)
- Visual analysis keywords properly detected
- Image compression and display working
- API integration functional
- **BROKEN**: UI image removal not syncing with data array

## Debug Status
- ✅ Syntax errors resolved
- ✅ Extension loading properly
- ✅ Comprehensive logging implemented
- ❌ Remove button functionality not working
- ⏳ Awaiting remove button test results
